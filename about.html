            Founded with a vision to provide quality education in a Christian environment, 
            Anointed Child Preparatory School has been shaping young minds since its establishment.

            <h2>History & Foundation</h2>
            <p>
               Anointed Child Preparatory School was established in 2005 with a clear vision: 
               to provide quality education that combines academic excellence with strong 
               Christian values. Our founders recognized the need for an educational institution 
               that would not only prepare children academically but also nurture their 
               spiritual and moral development.
            </p>
            <p>
               Starting with just 35 students in temporary facilities, the school has grown 
               significantly over the years. Through dedication and commitment to our mission, 
               we have expanded our infrastructure, developed comprehensive academic programs, 
               and built a reputation for excellence in the Atiwa East District and beyond.
            </p>
            <p>
               Today, we serve over 300 students from Nursery to Primary 6, with modern 
               facilities, qualified teaching staff, and a curriculum that meets both national 
               standards and international best practices.
